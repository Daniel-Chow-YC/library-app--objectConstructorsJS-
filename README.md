# Library Project (object constructors)

## Task
Create a small library app. This app should include:

- a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.
- a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library. 
- a button on each book’s display to change its read status. 
- local storage so when the user refreshes the page all of their books will be saved

## Still To Do:
- Make the app look more presentable.
